## What is it?

A UNIX terminal emulator written from the ground up as a
learning exercise. It depends on practically nothing. The
parsing, escape sequence implementation, etc. is all custom.

## Is it the best/fastest/most cromulent at $X?

No. Ironically the name doesn't even refer to a speed-related
goal. It's just a gag because it goes with the word Terminal
and my first thought, "illness", didn't have such a nice ring
to it.
